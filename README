* Goal

I keep my sample code for the algorithm class I'm teaching at
Northeastern Unviersity (CS5800). The goal of this is to help students
better understand the algorithms and techniques I cover in
class. Hence, I try to make the code expressive, without worrying
about making it general.

* Programming languages

The code is written in C++. I use unit tests [gtest/gmock] to verify
the corretness of all algorithm implementations.

* How to execute

I use cmake to simplify the build process for C++.  In general, you
can follow the following steps to run all unit tests.

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  ctest

* Misc
