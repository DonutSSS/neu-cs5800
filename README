I keep my sample code for the algorithm class I'm teaching at
Northeastern Unviersity (CS5800). The goal of this is to help students
better understand the algorithms and techniques I cover in
class. Hence, I try to make the code expressive, without worrying
about making it general.

The code is written in C++. And I chose to use google-mock to test
it. So in order to run them, you need to have gmock and gtest
installed.

I've also used cmake to simplify the build process, and supplied each
example with a CMakeLists.txt file (tough you may need to update the
reference location for gmock and gtest lib). In general, you can
follow the following steps to run each example.

  mkdir mybuild
  cd mybuild
  cmake ..
  make
  ./test
